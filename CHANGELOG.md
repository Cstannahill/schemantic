## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-13

### Added

- First-party React hooks generator with `createApiHooks(client)` factory, enabled via `--hooks` or `generateHooks: true`.
- Top-level exports for `HookGenerator` and `GeneratedHooksFile`.

### Changed

- Standardized generated client filename to `api-client.ts`; index now re-exports the client and hooks consistently.
- Improved naming normalization for types and client methods (sanitize invalid characters; PascalCase for type identifiers).

### Fixed

- Corrected index re-export path for CLI to avoid `.js` resolution type issues.
- Aligned generated hook call signatures with client method arity and parameter ordering.
